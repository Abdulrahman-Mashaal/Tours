Create a beautiful, custom landing page for a Tours website using HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript


As you can see in this project, I was trained to use some basic HTML, CSS, and javascript concepts as follows:

1- HTML:
- Abstract an HTML design to achieve our target.
- Divided our target into small parts by using <section> and <div> tags.
- Choose the correct name of the classes.
- Taking good practice in HTML.


2- CSS:
- understanding a CSS ' Cascading Style Sheet ' hierarchy by training.
- Take a snapshot of powerful  CSS to make the design appear like an awesome output.
- Trying a variety of properties to make design under control.
- Taking good practice in CSS.

3- JavaScript:
- Taking good practice in JavaScript.
